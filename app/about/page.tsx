              Ironmark was built on a simple frustration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
              We kept seeing what happened when great businesses got sold to the
              wrong buyers. The culture changed. The team left. The founder
              regretted it. A business that took decades to build got turned
              into a line item on someone&apos;s portfolio spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
              We started Ironmark because we wanted to be a different kind of
              buyer. Not a fund with an exit mandate. Not a strategic acquirer
              looking to absorb your brand into something bigger. Just a group
              of operators who genuinely believe that great businesses deserve
              great owners — and who are willing to do the work to earn that
              title.

          <FadeInUp delay={0.2} className="flex flex-col gap-5">
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
              Our inspiration is straightforward. We asked ourselves one
              question: if we were selling a business we&apos;d spent years building,
              what kind of buyer would we actually want?
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
              The answer shaped everything about how Ironmark operates.
              Long-term ownership. Hands-on operations. Founder-friendly
              transitions. Decisions made for the health of the business — not
              for a quarterly report or an eventual exit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
              We are entrepreneurs first. We respect what it takes to build
              something real. And we built Ironmark to be the company we&apos;d be
              proud to sell to ourselves.

                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  When we acquire a business, the first thing we do is listen.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  We spend the first 90 days learning — talking to your team,
                  understanding your systems, identifying what&apos;s working and
                  what&apos;s quietly holding the business back. We don&apos;t arrive with
                  a predetermined playbook. We show up with questions.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  From there we focus on three things: stabilizing operations,
                  strengthening the team, and building systems that let the
                  business grow without depending on any single person. Better
                  processes. Cleaner financials. Clearer ownership of decisions
                  at every level.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  We are not a passive holding company. We are active operators
                  who take what&apos;s already good and make it more durable.

                  Founders sell for different reasons. Retirement. Burnout. No

                  approach every conversation with patience and without pressure.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  We&apos;re flexible on structure. Full acquisition, majority
                  buyout, phased transition — we build the deal around your
                  situation, not ours. If you want to stay involved, we&apos;ll find
                  the right role. If you&apos;re ready to step back completely,
                  we&apos;ll make sure the business is in good hands before you do.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed">
                  What we won&apos;t do is promise one thing and deliver another.
                  Every commitment we make in the LOI, we honor at close.
